# execute them. If you're using the `doubleshot test`

#   require "jackson.jar"
# rescue LoadError
#   # Rescue the LoadError if you want to be able
#   # to run tests and what-not during development.
#   # You don't need to do anything in particular here,
#   # but we'll throw a warning just in case:
#   warn <<-EOS
# WARN: jackson.jar not loaded
# This probably means you're executing directly,
# without a Gem. If you get this message from your
